# AWS Cloud Labs

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey as I work through AWS Solutions Architect concepts and labs. Each folder contains a focused lab where I explore AWS services through practical, real-world scenarios.

My goal is to strengthen my cloud fundamentals by building, testing, and documenting every lab I complete. All reports are written in my own words without including any sensitive data or course content. More labs will be added continuously as I progress through my learning path.

**Current Labs**
- IAM Users, Groups, and Policies (Completed)
- More labs coming soon (EC2, VPC, S3, Networking, Monitoring, etc.)

Each lab folder includes:
- A short `README.md` (overview)
- A detailed lab report with steps, learnings, and takeaways

This repository reflects my ongoing commitment to building a strong foundation in cloud architecture and AWS security best practices.
